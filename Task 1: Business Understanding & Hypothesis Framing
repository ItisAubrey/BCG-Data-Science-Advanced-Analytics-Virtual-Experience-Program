# The brief from PowerCo
The Associate Director (AD) of the Data Science team held a team meeting to discuss the client brief. You’ll be working closely with Estelle Altazin, a senior data scientist on your team.

Here are the key takeaways from the meeting:

Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

First things first, you and Estelle need to understand the problem that PowerCo is facing at a deeper level and plan how you’ll tackle it. 


# Task requirements:
here’s what you’ll need to include in the eamil to AD：

You must formulate PowerCo’s issue as a problem using the 5 step data science process and lay out the major steps needed to test it.

What do you think are the key reasons for a customer deciding to stay with or switch energy providers? For example: price, is it clean energy, customer service, location etc.
What data do you think would be useful in order to investigate these key reasons? E.g. customer purchasing trends over past 5 years, location of business etc.
If you were to get this data, how could you analyse or visualize it to test whether these reasons may have an impact on churn?
